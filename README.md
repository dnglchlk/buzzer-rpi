# rpi-buzzer

This is a python cli application I've pretty much pulled out of my ass,
which will create visual and auditory alerts based on a severity level
that's passed to it either manually, or by another application's trigger.
The visual aspect of this application was designed for use on a RPi, hence
the name rpi-buzzer. The visual portion may not display correctly for you
in your console as it was specially designed for one purpose, so keep that
in mind if attempting to view it.
